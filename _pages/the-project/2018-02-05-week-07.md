This week was all about [coding the response](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/commit/e3265310d8ad94f3e89acc64b5910264e0dc47b1).

What I learned this week:

  * [`sendfile()`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html)
  system call: copies data between one file descriptor and another, within the
  kernel. This operation is more efficient (and so, faster) than using a
  combination of `read()`s and `write()`s, transferring data to and
  from user space.

HTTP/1 allows only one request-response transaction per connection, and this
is very well reflected in the definition of `MHD_Connection` struct.
HTTP/2 can have multiple of these request-response transactions (streams)
per connection (session) at a time, so several changes were introduced:

  - A stream has one MHD_Response object (multiple responses per connection).
  - Writing the response then depends on the stream, so the stream keeps
    track of the current write position in the actual response.
  - In order to use the `sendfile()` primitive, a `nghttp2_send_data_callback`
    function is implemented, so we can send a file directly, without having
    intermediate buffers.

What happens when receiving a request:

  * `http2_call_connection_handler()` calls the `MHD_AccessHandlerCallback`
    callback function for all the requests, defined in the MHD application.

    This function will be called:
    - After a HEADERS stream, if the HTTP request method is e.g. GET or HEAD.
    - After a HEADERS + DATA stream, if the HTTP request method is POST or PUT.

  * When the application calls `MHD_queue_response()`,
    `MHD_http2_queue_response()` executes and we build the response headers.

  * Then `response_read_callback()` is called, and depending on how the application
    created the response:
    - `MHD_create_response_from_data()`: the response body is a data buffer, the data is copied into the
      buffer (which will be sent later).
    - `MHD_create_response_from_fd()`: the response body is a file, we will either:
        - Read with the sendfile_adapter function.
        - Read with the response.c:`file_reader()`.
    - `MHD_create_response_from_callback()`: the response body is created within
      an application callback `response->crc()`.

  * The response is sent immediately (HEADERS + DATA frames).
