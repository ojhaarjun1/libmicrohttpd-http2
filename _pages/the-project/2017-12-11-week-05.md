title: Week 05

This week was all about coding a first prototype!

Now an HTTP/2 client can connect to our server, send a GET request and
receive a (fixed) response.

What I learned this week:

  * Use *asserts* to check values of variables or conditions. This will save you
    a lot of time in debugging and understanding the root of a problem (such
    as a segmentation fault!).

  * [h2spec](https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec) is a conformance testing tool
    for HTTP/2 implementation.
    This tool is compliant with [RFC 7540](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.txt)
    (HTTP/2) and [RFC 7541](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7541.txt) (HPACK).
    I use it to test (and debug :P) my code.

## Coding

  * Variables
    - daemon->*h2_settings*: server HTTP/2 settings, configured at start-up.

  * Structures
    - *http2_conn*: handles an HTTP/2 connection.
      Each connection has a unique session: connection->*h2*
      A session can have multiple active streams, stored in a doubly linked list
      <span class="note-08">(or do we need a hash table?)</span>.
      A session has its own settings (initialized by the daemon settings, they
      can change during the session): h2->*settings*

    - *http2_stream*: handles an HTTP/2 frame in a session.
      Every stream has a unique identifier in the session (in fact,
      odd-numbered identifiers!).

  * Functions
    - *send_callback*: nghttp2 doesn't use the MHD_Connection write_buffer for
      the responses.
