This week was all about rewriting the write functionality and creating a new
example .

While working on the [gophertiles](https://http2.golang.org/gophertiles) demo,
I tried the [clockstream](https://http2.golang.org/clockstream) demo.

This example made me think that the MHD example _minimal_example_comet.c_ wasn't
working properly: the server stopped the streaming when the flow control
window was full, neglecting the WINDOW_UPDATE frames that were telling to
increase the window!

So a hard phase of debugging and reading nghttp2 code turned out to be a success.

The main modifications involved rewriting the write function
([#29](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/pull/29)):

  - We are using the connection's read and write buffers for reading
    from and writing into the socket, respectively.
  - We read all the incoming frames using `read_buffer`, until there is no new
    frames. We enter into a `WRITE` state.
  - When receiving a HEADER frame (and so creating a new stream),
    all the header name/value fields are copied into the pool memory of this
    new stream.
  - We call the `default_handler` callback to let the MHD application to
    process the request and generate a response.
  - In `response_read_callback`, sometimes the buffer is not big enough to
    hold the response created by a MHD_ContentReaderCallback. We then use
    the response->data buffer as an intermediate buffer (just as a buffer
    response).
  - The flag NGHTTP2_DATA_FLAG_NO_COPY allows to copy the response directly to
    the connection's write_buffer in `send_data_callback`,
    not using the buffer provided by the nghttp2 library.
  - We call `nghttp2_session_mem_send` to fill the write_buffer with the other
    frames (e.g., HEADER, SETTINGS, RST_STREAM).
  - When the `write_buffer` is full, we send all this data to the socket calling
    the `send_cls` callback.
  - When there is no more data to send, we return to a `READ` state.

Other things I did:

  - Moved all debugging code to connection_http2_helper.h

  - [Issue #23](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/issues/23):
    Add a response trailer
    ([#30](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/pull/30)).

    Chunked transfers do not exist in HTTP/2, so all the related code for HTTP/1
    chunked uploads or responses is not used.

    See the [Trailing header fields example](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.3).

    The example [chunked_example.c](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/blob/master/src/examples/chunked_example.c)
    now shows how to add a trailer at the end of the response.

Enter the [clockstream](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/blob/master/src/examples/clockstream.c) demo:

  - This MHD application streams the current time every second
    (idea from [h2demo.go](https://http2.golang.org/clockstream),
    code from suspend_resume_epoll.c example).
