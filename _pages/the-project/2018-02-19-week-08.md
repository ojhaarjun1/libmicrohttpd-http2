This week was all about fixing bugs and passing tests.

  * Now [all h2spec tests pass](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/commit/7dc998ee5800b014bff1f739efcfed495f1d4845)
    (only 1 fails because of the nghttp2 library:
    _5.1.1-2 Sends stream identifier that is numerically smaller than previous_).

  * I tested all the [microhttpd examples](https://github.com/maru/http2-mhd-sandbox/tree/master/mhd-examples)
    with MHD_USE_HTTP2 flag in order to detect code that now needs to use
    the http2 structures.

  * Fixed several problems:
    - [Received headers](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/commit/556b7ddc08e9f0951bb0661add4f299c6fbeb9b5)
    - URL: [Query string and %HH decoding](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/commit/4be56b20eb9588b1dd38e4bf77a4059c5c10050e)
    - [Cookies and POST data](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/commit/2ee357072e470522a55ff30af93a3c6db07d9d15)

  * `http2_benchmark.c` shows that the HTTP/2 implementation is slower than
    the HTTP/1 one.
    [This needs to be improved](https://github.com/maru/libmicrohttpd-http2/issues/25).

  * Soon [gophertiles](https://http2.golang.org/gophertiles) demo using MHD ðŸ˜Š
