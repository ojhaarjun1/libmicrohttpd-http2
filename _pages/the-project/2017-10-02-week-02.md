This week was all about MHD code analysis and design of the new API.

## MHD code
  * function **MHD_start_daemon_va**: starts the web server
    * Parses options `parse_options_va()`
    * (if https) Initializes HTTPS certificates
    * `bind()`s and `listen()`s
    * Creates the thread that runs the epoll/poll/select loop (until the daemon is explicitly shut down)

  * In the event processing function, the following functions are called:
    * `MHD_accept_connection`: `accept()`s an incoming connection.
    * `internal_add_connection`: creates an MHD_Connection object, set the receive and send callbacks (see next item),
       and inserts the connection in the connections list.
    * `MHD_set_http_callbacks_` / `MHD_set_https_callbacks`: set *recv_cls* and *send_cls* callbacks,
      functions for reading requests and writing responses:
      * http: `recv_param_adapter`, `send_param_adapter`
      * https: `recv_tls_adapter`, `send_tls_adapter`

  * Connection handlers (both HTTP and HTTPS):
    * `MHD_connection_handle_read`: reads data from socket to **read_buffer** by calling `recv_cls`.
    * `MHD_connection_handle_idle`: parses data from **read_buffer**. <span class="note-08">Expects HTTP/1 syntax</span>.
    * `MHD_connection_handle_write`: writes data to socket by calling `send_cls`

### Connection states

These are the different states that a connection can be in:

![Connection state: Request]({{ site.baseurl }}static/img/connection_state-1.jpg)
*Connection state: Request*

![Connection state: Response]({{ site.baseurl }}static/img/connection_state-2.jpg)
*Connection state: Response*

## Design

List inspired by *[The practice of programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Programming)*:

  * Interfaces: what services and access are provided?  
    * connection_http2.c: handles a single HTTP/2 connection (session), with its own streams, frames, flow control, prioritization and server push services.
      Defines its own *MHD_connection_handle_read*, *MHD_connection_handle_idle* and *MHD_connection_handle_write* HTTP2 functions.
  * Information hiding: what is visible? what is private?
    * Visible: same API as in **connection.h**:
      * MHD_set_http_callbacks_
      * MHD_connection_handle_read
      * MHD_connection_handle_write
      * MHD_connection_handle_idle
      * MHD_connection_mark_closed_
      * MHD_connection_close_
      * MHD_connection_finish_forward_
      * MHD_connection_epoll_update_
      * MHD_update_last_activity_
    * Private:
      * Session (connection) data
      * Streams: add, remove from session (stored in a DLL)
      * Set `nghttp2_session_callbacks`
      * Send and receive data from nghttp2 library
  * Resource management: memory, shared information, sockets.
    * As in **connection.c**
  * Error handling: detect, report, how? Recovery.
    * As in **connection.c**
